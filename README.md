# Electrix
An Internal CS:GO Cheat.

I currently have a lot of drama and school related stuff around me and I really cannot work on this cheat anymore so, here you go.

The cheat is based on Daniel Krupinski's cheat (here's a link): https://github.com/danielkrupinski/Osiris
Full credit goes to him he still makes frequent updates on it, so you can go and check it out.

My version of the cheat is basically just legit aimbot with Bunny Hop. Perfect for youtubers/streamers if you ask me. (lol zuhn)

What my version of the cheat has:

- A Legit Aimbot
- Bunny Hop
- Config System 

Configs are being saved in a folder called "Electrix" in Documents.

If you add/remove features from the source it might have a slight trouble loading the whole config properly but it's not that big of a deal.

Nothing much has changed, I've basically:

- Added a new menu
- Removed unnecessary features for the aimbot
- Limited some features of the aimbot for example you can't use RCS X and RCS Y from Pistols to XM1014 and AWP and SSG08.
- And basically copy pasted the Bunny Hop and the Config System and code straight from him.

But ugh yea, again thanks for all the support and help. Stay safe friends.
